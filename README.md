# ChromeTabStorage

# Hello! 🙌

Hello, I'm Jerry. This project was born out of a personal need. I've always been the type to have a plethora of tabs open, aiming to keep track of my studies or ongoing projects.

To prevent such disruptions and to ensure that I never lose my place, I embarked on this project. It boasts a clean yet intuitive GUI, suitable for all users. I've incorporated this tool into my daily routine, and it's been invaluable in keeping my digital workspace organized.
