# ChromeTabStorage

Hello! 🙌
I am Jerry. This is actually a fun project I made for myself. I've always been someone who loves to open a plethora of tabs, aiming to keep myself on track with my studies or projects. Sometimes, I might have over 20 tabs open, and if I accidentally close them, retrieving every single webpage becomes a daunting task. Not only does this waste time, but it also disrupts the flow of my studies.

To preserve my enthusiasm and ensure I don't lose my place in my digital exploration, I created this project. It features a neat but intuitive GUI suitable for all users. Personally, I use this app every day to keep my tabs sorted and organized.
